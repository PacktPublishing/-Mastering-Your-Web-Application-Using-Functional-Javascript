# Mastering Your Web Application Using Functional Javascript [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Your Web Application Using Functional Javascript [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-your-web-application-using-functional-javascript-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788298254), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course, you will be comfortable using functional programming to handle asynchronous code (events and fetching APIs), error handling and writing clean functional code that can handle unknown values without becoming difficult to read.

To accomplish this, we’ll learn about building Type-classes, functional types that are used to specifically handle situations like this while keeping code looking familiar (an easy interface), pure and of very DRY.

We will build a Functor into a Monad piece by piece and do examples showing how each part is useful and how their simple API can almost magically handle so many difficult concerns without too much code. You’ll learn about Maybe, Either, Future and even Reactive Streams with Observables to write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous FP. 

Take this course if you already understand the fundamentals of Functional JavaScript. It is assumed that you know about closures, composition, higher-order functions like map, filter and reduce, currying, and that you are familiar with using basic Promises.
